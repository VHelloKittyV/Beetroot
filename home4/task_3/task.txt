Hi there,
When Smashing Magazine approached Netlify, they managed a dizzying number of tools across different functional areas of their site including their magazine, content, e-commerce platform, comments engine, subscription service and member login. 


6x their site speed, from a load time of 800 ms to just 80 ms 
Migrate from several disparate tools to a single unified platform
Build a design they loved without the limitations of WordPress
Develop the most performant site possible with a focus on reliability and speed.

    

Markus Seyfferth
CEO, Smashing Magazine

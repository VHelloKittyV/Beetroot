            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            <a href="">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an
            introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and

            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
            capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components:
            <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</em> You can learn more
            about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
            components work in React Native.

            React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source
            library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the
            most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
          </p>
          <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
            React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
            that need names and a cafe to work in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
            that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
            <span>&lt;Text&lt;Hello&gt;, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The React docs have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you
            can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
            variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for
            the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
            <span>&lt;Text&gt;</span>
          </p>
          <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments
            you use to configure how components render, state is like a
            component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
            that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
            gives your components memory!

          handling text input <sup class="chapter">chapter 4</sup>
        </h2>

          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop that takes a function to be called
            every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes
            a function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
